##Content Summary##

#####Front#####

#####Body#####

1. The Account from WICKHAM,
(Lately published by Iohn Raunce and Charles Harris)
Examined, and found False:

1. In the 5th Page of their Account they have printed a Letter, sent to the second dayes
Meeting in London, on the 13th of the 5th Month 1687. signed by Joshua
Kinch, &c. requiring an Answer by the 26th of that Month. To which an Answer
was returned from the same Meeting on the 25th of the same Month. But
since they had not Ingenuity or Plainness enough, to publish the Answer together
with the Letter, pretending they had no satisfying Answer; the Answer
it self is herewith now published, for the satisfaction of such as from their dark
Insinuation, might think there had been no Answer at all given thereto.
